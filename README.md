# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis
Mvaen Analytics LLC. recently launched a feauture "Guided Project". Coffee Shop Sales Analysis is a guided project which helps aspiring analyst to test their skills. 

# Project Overview:
Maven Coffee Shop is a small chain of coffee shops located in New York City at three locations, Astoria, Hell's Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan. We have six months of transaction data from the shop. 

The project involved analyzing transaction data from Maven Coffee Shop to uncover sales trends and patterns. 

Key tasks included:

 - Data preparation: Added calculated fields for revenue, month, day of week, and hour to enrich the dataset for analysis.
 - Exploration: Used PivotTables in Excel to analyze sales by time period, product category, and top products.
 - Dashboard creation: Built interactive visualizations and charts in a dashboard to showcase insights. Added a location filter to enable dynamic views.
 - Trend analysis: Identified peaks in revenue on Fridays/Saturdays and a morning/lunch rush hour pattern. Opportunities exist to optimize staffing and product offerings.
 - Recommendations: Proposed targeted cross-selling, new product flavors, and staggered staffing based on sales patterns. Aim to maximize high-traffic periods and boost slower periods.
In summary, the analysis uncovered clear weekly and hourly trends, and opportunities to optimize operations and marketing to address sales peaks and valleys. The interactive dashboard provides an ongoing view into sales and product metrics.

# Tool Used:
- Microsoft Excel

# Analysis Process:
I started by cleaning and enriching the raw dataset, adding columns for revenue, month, day, and hour. Excel PivotTables enabled me to slice the data and analyze trends over time, by product category, and across locations. I then built an interactive dashboard with filters to showcase key findings.

# Key Insights:
- Total monthly revenue was $698K over 150K transactions
- Brewed teas and coffees accounted for the top-selling items
- Fridays and Saturdays saw peak sales volumes
- Mornings and lunch hours (7-11am, 12-2pm) were the busiest times

# Recommendations:
Based on the trends, I recommended optimizing staffing for busy periods, expanding product offerings to boost slower periods, and targeted promotions to increase cross-selling.

# Impact:
This project strengthened my analytics skills in data preparation, visualization, and dashboarding. Identifying actionable insights also improved my strategic thinking capabilities. I'm excited to apply these learnings in future analyses!
